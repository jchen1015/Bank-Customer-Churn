# Bank-Customer-Churn

This is a supervised learning project to develop algorithms for telecommunications service vendors to predict customer churn probability based on labeled data. 

Steps of Predicting Banking Churn Probability:
- Preprocessed dataset by data exploring, data cleaning, categorical feature transformation and standardization. 
- Trained supervised machine learning models including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, and applied regularization with optimal parameters to overcome overfitting. 
- Evaluated model performance of classification accuracy 0.86 via 10-fold-validation technique and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results.
